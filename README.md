# PCA_using_wine_data
This Python code first imports necessary libraries, loads a wine dataset, and prints the dataset. It then separates the data and labels, plots a scatter plot of the data's first and third columns color-coded by labels, and displays a legend.

The code proceeds to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with 2 components on the original data and prints the transformed data along with its shape.

Next, it standardizes the data, applies PCA again, and plots the transformed data in a scatter plot with labels and a legend.
